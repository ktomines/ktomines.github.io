For the fourth WOD, the assignment was an invoice chart that provided sales data for five products. The WOD was to demonstrate the utilization of expressions and variables and deal with dynamic data.

My experience with this WOD was okay, it did take me a long time because I didn't assign the right values to some variables because there was so many, but eventually, I got the  hang of it. 

To prepare myself for this WOD, I took notes of the different steps I needed to take and the variables I needed to input in to my html. 

I think to better prepare, I think I am going to try and remember the first five steps, so that I don't heavily relay on my notes when doing the WODs.
