I had no idea how to even start BrowserHistory 1, so I "cheated" and watched the screencast solution first when you're not supposed to. I began watching the video  while also doing the exercise, side by side for about an hour. After I got the hang of it, I took notes of the steps for the WOD and began to screencast. I would only look at the notes if I got really really stuck, but most of the time I tried my best to go purely off my memory. 
I think it took me about 3 times for BrowserHistory 1, 2, & 3, until I got the hang of doing them. I began screen casting after I got the hang of the exercises because I felt like I could remember more by the pressure of the timer. 
I recommend watching the videos first, even though you're not supposed to haha. It will give you familiarity and it will save you time instead of just doing something completely new that you have no idea how to start. 
I believe BrowserHistory 1 was the hardest one to do in my opinion because most of the concept tags mentioned were completely new to me. I believe I spent 2 hours on the first exercise because I wanted to take my time on why each tag did what and why my webpage wasn't working. BrowserHistory 2 & 3, were difficult, but not as difficult as the first one because it was just formatting, which turned out to be actually fun!
