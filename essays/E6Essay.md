Briefly describe your system (e.g. A store selling Pokemon game cards)
Our store is a Boba Shop that also sells scones, smoothies, and ice cream.


Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?
Not that I can think of. 

Describe what you are most proud of about your system:
The sessions and cookies working, our nav bar, and the styling of our website. 

Describe what you are least happy with your system:
I am least happy with the products_display.html image, I couldn't figure out how to fix the padding or container to fit the image at a reasonable size. 

How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?
Developing this assignment was more strict and managed rather than in A2 we would not meet everyday.

When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?
We would cry, take a break, or put Beyonce on to empower us. And if we couldn't figure it out after coming back, we would ask Professor Kazman for help, Rei the TA, as well as our peers, and even tried working with a Tutor online, shoutout to everyone that helped. 

Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?
The team work worked incredibly well in this assignment. When one of us was about to give up, the other would uplift them and reassure them that we can do it. 

Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?
Asking a tutor for help was one of the things that didn't work at all. The tutor couldn't understand how our website worked and how the app.post & app.gets worked, so in conclusion, it was a waste of time and money. 

What did you learn from doing this assignment?
I learned a lot about javascript and its fundamentals, as well as how important it is team work and time management really is.

If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
If I could go back in time, I would take more notes and keep track of variable names more because those were the death of us. 

Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
a. 12.5%
b. 12.5%
c. 75%

Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)
Me: 50%
Margaret AKA Maggie: 50%
I worked on the .css and .html and my partner worked on the sessions and cookies, and we both worked together for the server and majority of the project.
