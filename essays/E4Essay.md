My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:
Through the Assignment1 project, I was able to wrap my head around the concepts of Javascript such as if and else statements, the difference between server.js and live-server, and how to upload my code to a public server.

I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:

Although I learned more, I believe I still need to improve my programming skills when it comes to connecting the different html forms to a server. It was difficult making sure I had all the right code to properly connect them. I also need to work on my debugging skills and to stay calm when my forms aren't working. 

I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first.
I disagree with this statement, as much as I would like to be able to do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions first, I learn better by watching and then doing myself. Coding is incredibly new to me, so I still have trouble even with the most basic things.

The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
I agree with this statement. The labs have helped me learn, especially when Professor Kazman walks us through them. 

I feel ready I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications like Assignment 1).

I disagree, I do not feel like I am ready to work on the next stage of complexity in programming. Assignment1 put me on the edge (just kidding), but I will probably need to go to office hours again. 

I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:

I believe updating the screencasts will be very helpful for future classes. For example, Assignment1, I followed the screencast provided, however, I learned from Prof Kazman that I wasn't supposed to do it the way that was explained in the screencast. 

These are things that work really well for my learning in this class:

Screencasts, office hours, my classmates, and w3 schools helped a lot.
